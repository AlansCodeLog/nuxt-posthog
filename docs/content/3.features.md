## `$clientPosthog` & `$serverPosthog`

Nuxt PostHog provides two global variables to easily use PostHog's [client](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js) or [server](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/node) object:

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { $clientPosthog, $serverPosthog } = useNuxtApp();

if (process.server) {
  $serverPosthog?.capture({ 
    distinctId: '<user-id>',
    event: 'my-server-event',
  });
}

onMounted(() => {
  $clientPosthog?.capture('my-event')
})
</script>
```

::callout

This utility is typed and will provide suggestions while coding once you check that it is not `void`
::

## Capture events

Nuxt PostHog provides a [Vue directive](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives) that will automatically capture an event when the HTML element is clicked:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
    <button v-posthog-capture="'cta_clicked'">
      Get Started
    </button>
</template>
```

::callout
☝️ Whenever this button is clicked, an event will be sent to PostHog automatically
::

::callout
---
icon: i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle
color: amber
---

You might find that the event is not being triggered when using the directive on a custom component. Citing [Vue official documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives#usage-on-components):

> Using custom directives on components is not recommended. Unexpected behaviour may occur when a component has multiple root nodes.
::

This directive also accepts an object if you want to provide additional properties to this event:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
    <button v-posthog-capture="{
      name: 'event',
      properties: {
        color: 'red',
      },
    }">
      Get Started
    </button>
</template>
```

::callout
---
icon: i-heroicons-sparkles
---

This directive is typed and will provide suggestions while coding
::

### Listen to custom events

You can listen to custom events (other than the default `click`) by passing in the event to the directive as an argument:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <button v-posthog-capture:auxclick="'aux-clicked'">
    Custom event!
  </button>
</template>
```

### Auto-capture page views

By default, this module will capture page views automatically. If not desired, you can change this behavior:

```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  posthog: {
    capturePageViews: false
  }
})
```

### Auto-capture page leaves

By default, this module will capture page leaves automatically. If not desired, you can change this behavior:

```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  posthog: {
    capturePageLeaves: false
  }
})
```

## Feature Flags

Nuxt PostHog provides two ways of working with PostHog's feature flags:

- `usePostHogFeatureFlag` composable
- `PostHogFeatureFlag` component

### `usePostHogFeatureFlag` composable

This composable provides utilities to work with PostHog's feature flags. It can check the value of a feature flag and get it's properties:

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { isFeatureEnabled, getFeatureFlag } = usePostHogFeatureFlag();
</script>
```

### `<PostHogFeatureFlag>` component

This component will allow you to hide content under a feature flag without having to import the `usePostHogFeatureFlag` composable or use the `$clientPosthog` or `$serverPosthog` variables:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <PostHogFeatureFlag v-slot="{ payload }" name="feature-test" match="variant">
    <div>This content is under a feature flag</div>
    <div>This is the feature flag payload: {{ payload }}</div>
  </PostHogFeatureFlag>
<template>
```
